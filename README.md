 🚀 CodeMate

CodeMate is an early-stage **developer collaboration platform** built to help students and beginner developers find like-minded people to work with on programming projects.

The core idea behind CodeMate is simple:

> *Many developers have ideas but struggle to find the right people to build with.*

CodeMate aims to bridge that gap by enabling users to create profiles, select interests, discover similar developers, and connect with them.
